Arrays
------

Ever thought that a single variable can hold multiple data..
one int a can store multiple integers..?

Is this actually possible and this is possible?

Yes this is..
by using arrays this possible..

BUTT

WHY NEED ARRAYS WHEN WE CAN CREATE INFINITE NUMBER OF VARIABLES?

What happens when we create too many variables?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Editor (the place where we write code) will be filled with VARIABLES
2. It is tough to refer to a variable immediately
3. Taking input and printing output is tough
4. Ramdom memory allocation
5. A good program needs to always give the output in the best way possible by using least memory and less time complexity


1) How to declare an Array?

    We declare int a; 
    this means that gives line declares a variable a,
    which is of integer data type, 

    Simillary to declare an Array of integers, we do it as..
    int a[5];
    This means that declare an array of integer datatype,
    which can hold 5 int values..

    int         a          [5]
    |           |           |
    |           |           |
    datatype variable Name  size    ----  [] is known as subscript of the array

                a - 10 bytes
    0           1           2           3           4    
    -----------------------------------------------------
    a[0]        a[1]        a[2]        a[3]        a[4]

    Now there is something important ,
    -> 0 ,1,2,3,4 are called indexes of the array.. 
    -> index of an array of any datatype starts with 0 to size-1
    -> example here we declared 5 int data types then,,.. indexes of these would be 0 to 4
    -> these indexes are \used to refer to the value of the variable in that particular index..

2) How are these helpful?

    -> indtead of using int a,b,c,d,e
    -> i can use only one variable.. int a[5]..
    -> this makes things easier and smooth.. (to code)
