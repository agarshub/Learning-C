1. Format Specifiers are used as keywords in C langugage to print a particular value stored inside a variable.
    These are generally and more often used in printf() statements as they tell the datatype of the vairbales.

2. Some format specifiers include:
    %d - int (integer)
    %c - char (character)
    %f - float (float)
    %ld - long int (long integer- here size is more)
    %s - short int (short integer - here size is less than int)
    %lf - double (long float- it is floating point number but larger value than float)
    %Lf - long double (long Double whose size is larger than double)
    %s - char array or string

    -> Here, the int char float double long are all known as datatypes

3. definition section is where we define values to be used in later part of the code.
4. for defining such things we use the command #define value_name value.
5. we can pass values through this section which will replaced by the later part of code.
    Example: #define Circumferece(x) 2*3.14*x
    wherever the Circumferece(value) is written it gets substitued with 2*3.14*value

    note that the variable need not be used as x it can be r,z ,y or any particular char and even x also.. it can also be a value..
