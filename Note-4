Loops
-----

-> Loops are just like goto statements but they are more readble since the conditions are previously known.
-> They are of two types.
    -> Top testing loops (or) Entry control loop
            (condition)
            {
                statement
                statement
                statement
                .
                .
                ..
                statements
            }
    
    -> Bottom testing loops (or) Exit control loop
            {
                statement
                statement
                statement
                .
                .
                ..
                statements
            }(condition)
    
    
1) Entry Control loops (or) Top Testing loops
    -> These are furtehr divided into 
        1. For Loop
        2. While Loop
2) Exit control loop (or) Bottom Testing Loops
    -> The type of this loop is 
        1. Do While Loop

Some important points
---------------------

1. Generally we use top testing loops more often.. but they are cases where do while loops are more better to use.
2. When question is in should we use WHILE loop or FOR loop. it depends on what problem we are solving.
3. If we know that how many times the number of times loop is gonna run ,.. use for loop... 
4. but if we have no idea of about how many times the loop can run based on a condition which we dont know.. its better to use while loop
5. This simple strategy might be helpful in solving the codes.
